        <h4>Description</h4>
        <p>
            Philippine adobo is a popular Filipino dish and cooking process in Philippine cuisine 
            that involves meat, seafood, or vegetables marinated in vinegar, 
            soy sauce, garlic, bay leaves, and black peppercorns, which is browned in oil, 
            and simmered in the marinade.

        <p>
            There are four main traditional cooking methods using vinegar in the Philippines: 
            kiniláw (raw seafood in vinegar and spices), 
            paksíw (a broth of meat with vinegar and spices), 
            sangkutsá (pre-cooked braising of meat in vinegar and spices), 
            and finally adobo (a stew of vinegar, garlic, salt/soy sauce, and other spices).
            It is believed that paksíw, sangkutsá, and adobo are all derivations of kiniláw. 
            They are also related to cooking techniques like sinigáng and pinangát na isdâ that 
            also have a sour broth, albeit using fruits like calamansi, tamarind, unripe mangoes, 
            bilimbi, santól, and star fruit as souring agents instead of vinegar.
