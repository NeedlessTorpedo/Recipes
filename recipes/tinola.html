        <h4>Description</h4>
        <p>
            Tinola is a Filipino soup usually served as a main entrée with white rice. 
            Traditionally, this dish is cooked with chicken or fish, wedges of papaya, 
            and leaves of the siling labuyo chili pepper in broth flavored with ginger, onions and fish sauce.

        <p>
            One of the earliest mentions of the dish is in José Rizal's first novel, 
            Noli Me Tangere, where Kapitan Tiago served it to Crisostomo Ibarra upon 
            arriving from Europe. He was given the breast, to the dismay of the corrupt Spanish friar, Padre Damaso, 
            who got chicken neck, which is considered to be the least favored chicken part.

        <h4>Steps on Making Tinola</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>Get a pot and bring it up to medium heat before pouring in the oil. 
                Drop in the onions, garlic and ginger and sauté slowly for about 
                2 minutes or until you can smell the lovely aroma.</li>
            <li>It’s time to drop in the chicken pieces and stir until it turns white or light brown in color.</li>
            <li>Pour in the water and add your Knorr Chicken Broth cubes. 
                Bring this to a simmer until chicken is tender and cooked through.</li>
            <li>You can now add your sayote or green papaya and cook until tender.</li>
            <li>Dahon ng sili is added at the last stage to ensure leaves (and nutrients) don’t dry up. 
                Give this a minute then it is done. Malunggay is also another healthy alternative 
                because it is packed with vitamins and minerals which are good for nursing moms 
                and kids as well.</li>
            <li>Enjoy this with patis and calamansi on the side. 
                See the faces of your whole family light up as you bring this to the table.</li>
        </ol>
